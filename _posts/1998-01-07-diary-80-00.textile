p(big). Why should I photograph strange people?
I’m rather interested in the gaps.
The gap between the foot and the wall.
Between the hand and the bench

you ask for understanding
the less you get,

p(big). You should only 
touch me
with a touch 
that asks nothing
I can’t do that, said the actor.
I’m dead and I want the life from you.

p(small). The question about intimacy.
And over and over:
You believe to see something,

p(big). we are like children
are my eyes able to lie?
When I wake up, I don’t remember where I am.
We paint what we did
...are older grown, then you’ll realise that photos pictures can be eaten.“
They’re only laughing.
They don’t need pictures.
They only know one time. (They’re still clear and light as clean water.)
But me I eat pictures every night. In the yellow light when everybody is sleeping. (In order to have enough.)

p(small). February 18th 97
Mainstation Zurich in the train.
We’re not running yet.
The old lady in the compartment next to me says: 
„Could you please close the window? There is a draft.“
I say no.

p(big). Feb 05
Picture of the past night. blurry.
rainy.
Dark hair and white cloth, eyes that eat into my body like moving fire. Grained memories next to it.

p(big). walking
is crap
I don’t know if it’s allowed to smoke there.
I still have a darling sure
I don’t always carry a grand in my pocket.

p(small). human destiny
Necessity?
-Voyeurism
Depressed eastern photograph
Clothes: vapid colours
Card and checked pattern
Grey face
Doesn’t like to comment on the future.

p(small). What can’t be seen anymore? Distinction from the past.
Old people, children, kitties, animals, you’ll get all four.
he says.
I don’t want to ask anything, I think, he doesn’t like to answer.

p(big). red lipstick. Blood red.
dirty coffee

p(small). I scarify
his picture in
my skin

p(big). Why don’t we
live there
where our power of imagination
stops?

 !(small)../img/diary-80-00/ruth-erdt-diary-80-00-10-600.jpg(Ruth Erdt, Diary 80-00)!
p(big). The only thing 
that calms me right now
is to trace photos,
copy
over and over
go away sun
I need to work
I draw to live.

p(small). It’s like having a lot of letters
